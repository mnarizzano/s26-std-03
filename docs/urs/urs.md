## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 Document Scope

The Wizard consumes a disassembly model expressed as a JSON file — the same format produced by the existing **Disassembly Flow Diagram Builder** application— and turns it into human-usable disassembly instructions. Accordingly, the model encodes the product as an AND/OR graph of components (Root, Composite, Leaf), composite operations (diamonds) and sequential atomic sub-steps (action circles).

The scope of this URS covers: importing and validating the JSON model, letting the operator choose the desired depth of disassembly at runtime, guiding the operator step-by-step through the disassembly, capturing data during execution (quality grading, optionally measured weight), **and producing a menu within multiple output formats can be chosen.**

## 2. System Description

The Disassembly Wizard is a guided application that transforms a disassembly model into actionable disassembly instructions. It imports a JSON model through its GUI, validates that the model is a well-formed AND/OR graph and reports any problems precisely, then lets the operator choose how deeply the product should be taken apart — from full disassembly down to material level, to keeping selected assemblies whole as recoverable blocks. Once the depth is confirmed, the Wizard guides the operator step-by-step through the procedure in real time, capturing a quality grading (and optionally a measured weight) for each component as it is removed. From the same session it produces two outputs: a procedural disassembly guide (PDF, optionally video) that documents how to take the product apart, and a decisional recovery report that records, for every component, its grading, its destination (resell, scrap, recover material) and its recovery-relevant materials. This section describes the context that motivates the Wizard and the objectives it is expected to meet.

### 2.1 Context and Motivation

The recovery of Critical Raw Materials from end-of-life products depends on disassembling those products effectively. The existing Builder lets a modeller describe how a product is taken apart, encoding the decomposition as an AND/OR graph stored in JSON. However, the Builder stops at modelling: it produces a graph, not instructions a technician can follow, and it performs no validation of the model it stores.

The Disassembly Wizard closes this gap. It takes the modelled JSON and makes it actionable: it checks that the model is well formed, lets the operator decide how deeply to disassemble a given unit, walks the operator through the procedure, and records the outcome of each step. Because the same product can be disassembled to different depths depending on the recovery goal (sell a working assembly whole vs. break it down to material level), the Wizard treats the disassembly depth as an explicit runtime decision rather than a fixed property of the model.

For this project the JSON model — not its graphical rendering — is the authoritative reference. The Wizard is therefore specified primarily against the JSON structure and its semantics.

### 2.2 Project Objectives

The objectives of the Disassembly Wizard are:

1. **Consume a disassembly model.** Import a JSON model through a GUI and parse it into the internal AND/OR graph representation.
2. **Guarantee model validity before use.** Validate the structure and grammar of the model, report any problems precisely, and let the operator make an informed decision to proceed or fix the model.
3. **Let the operator choose the disassembly depth.** Offer mutually exclusive disassembly-level options (full disassembly, keep main assemblies, manual selection of sub-roots) before generating the guide.
4. ~~**Guide disassembly in real time.** Walk the operator through the steps following the graph order, in execution mode.~~
5. ~~**Capture recovery-relevant data.** Record a configurable quality grading per component and, where applicable, supporting data needed for the recovery decision.~~
6. ~~**Produce usable outputs.** Generate a procedural disassembly guide (PDF, and optionally video) and a decisional recovery report.~~
7. ~~**Support CRM recovery.** Surface the components and materials that matter for Critical Raw Material recovery in the recovery report.~~
8. **Produce an interface where the user can select the output format. That interface has to be modular in order to add formats whenever we want

## 3. Requirements

| Priority | Meaning |
| --------------- | ----------- |
| M | **Mandatory:** required for the first version; the Wizard has no value without it. |
| D | **Desiderable:** high added value; planned for the first version if time allows. |
| O | **Optional:** useful but expendable; implemented only if spare effort remains. |
| E | **Future Enhancement:** explicitly out of current scope; recorded for a later iteration. |
